Normally, in feeding infants, gradual introduction of solid foods after 4–6 months of age is an important developmental as well as nutritional step.In cases of severe and multiple food allergies or intolerances, PurAmino is sometimes continued as a milk substitute in the diet of children. This and similar supplemental use of PurAmino in the diet beyond 24 months of age may make a significant contribution to maintenance of good nutrition in such patients. When PurAmino is used as a milk substitute, the total calcium content of the diet should be assessed. Extended use of PurAmino (or other infant formulas) as a sole source of diet is most appropriately monitored by physicians and nutritionists on a case-by-case basis, with attention to developmental as well as nutritional implications of such a dietary regimen. Ask your doctor if PurAmino is right for your infant or toddler.

					,Keep your clothes clean and the planet happy with the world's smartest laundry detergent. Featuring smartclean technology, a patent-pending ultra concentrated, biodegradable, plant-based formula, method laundry detergent will give you outstanding cleaning power and a super green footprint. And thanks to a compact design and a no-mess, precision-dosing pump that's designed for one-handed use, method laundry detergent couldn't be easier or more convenient to use., , The detergent is ultra concentrated--8x concentrated, to be exact-- so you need a much smaller amount than other leading brands, which means you'll also be using less water and other resources to wash your clothes. The result is a 35% smaller carbon footprint than conventional 2x concentrated detergent., , Unlike conventional detergents in which the cleaning agents are surrounded by water, method laundry detergent relies on its patent-pending ,™. This reverses the equation and puts the cleaning agents on the outside and the water on the inside., The cleaning agents are like magnets.

Bacteria can spread from one fabric to another in the laundry basket, from the washing-machine drum to the next load. Some of these bacteria can survive following the wash cycle. When it comes to certain laundry loads such as children's clothes or sportswear, you want to eliminate bacteria that may cause illnesses and create lingering bad smells. But detergents alone don't actually kill all bacteria. Introducing Lysol Laundry Sanitizer, an additive specially designed to kill 99.9% of bacteria in laundry*. Simply add Lysol Laundry Sanitizer to your rinse cycle. It does not contain any chlorine bleach and even works in cold water so is safe to use on most fabrics including whites, colors and darks.

But it’s not just a baby’s body that needs extra special care. Did you know that the scalp is one of the most sensitive areas on your baby’s body? That’s why the best baby shampoo should moisturize as well as cleanse. Enriched with our unique ¼ moisturizing cream, Baby Dove Rich Moisture Shampoo goes beyond mildness to help replenish the essential moisture and nutrients that your baby’s scalp can lose at bathtime to leave hair soft and healthy looking. Tear free and pH neutral, our baby shampoo is ophthalmologist, dermatologist and pediatrician tested, so you can enjoy bathtime knowing that your baby is getting the care they need. Hypoallergenic and mild cleansers in Baby Dove Rich Moisture Shampoo help your baby’s hair feel soft and delicately scented. And after bathtime? You’ll both be ready for that snuggle before bedtime. For a complete bathtime experience, pair shampoo with our Baby Dove Tip to Toe Wash and Baby Dove Lotion. The trio of products is everything you need to ensure baby’s skin stays clean and moisturized – thanks to Baby Dove, a brand you can trust.

In fact, it’s so delicate that it’s actually 30% thinner than ours, making it more vulnerable. So if your baby has sensitive skin, at bathtime you would want to use the best baby wash, one that gently cares for their sensitive skin. After all, your baby’s skin barrier is also delicate and much weaker than ours – it loses moisture up to 5 times faster than ours. That’s why we created a range of sensitive skin baby products, including our Baby Dove Sensitive Moisture Tip to Toe Wash. With a pH-neutral formula, it helps to replenish the essential moisture and nutrients that your baby’s skin loses during bathing. Baby Dove Sensitive Moisture Tip to Toe Wash for sensitive skin keeps baby’s skin looking healthy and moisturized, so you can give their delicate skin the care it needs to keep healthy and hydrated. Only Baby Dove adds back what other mild baby cleansers remove. Ophthalmologist, dermatologist and pediatrician-tested, with Baby Dove you know you’re looking after your baby’s delicate skin. Hypoallergenic and fragrance-free, the creamy lather of this baby wash for sensitive skin gently cleanses skin while helping it to retain its natural moisture. For skin that’s soft and clean, a tear-free bath awaits.

But together our choices add up, and we can make a difference by using 100% recycled paper* bath tissue. If every household in the U.S. replaced one 4-pack of 240-sheet virgin fiber bathroom tissue with this product, we could help save over 740,000 trees**. Pretty remarkable, right? But just because you care about the environment, doesn’t mean the products you use have to work any less. Seventh Generation 100% Recycled Paper* Bath Tissue is an extra strong and soft 2-ply toilet paper whitened without chlorine bleach. It’s gentle on the environment, septic-safe and RV-friendly, too. | For more than 25 years, Seventh Generation has been thoughtfully formulating safe and effective plant-based products that work. Really well. Seventh Generation Free & Clear 100% recycled* toilet paper and paper towels are made with no added dyes, inks, or fragrances. Our Free & Clear paper is Forest Stewardship Council certified as FSC Recycled* (FSC C115279).

After using Proteomics studies to examine hair damage at the molecular level, Nexxus scientists found that the main cause of color loss and dullness happens the moment hair is colored. Our scientists have developed a one-of-a-kind PROTEINFUSION blend infused with Elastin Protein and Quinoa along with other ingredients to create Color Assure formulas that result in long lasting color vibrancy for up to 40 washes. Along with an updated look, Nexxus is expanding the Color Assure range to include new formats that create an optimal regimen for color care, making it easier for people to help keep their color looking vibrant for longer. The range will include: a shampoo, conditioner, cleansing conditioner, purple shampoo for blonde and silver shades and a deep treatment masque. At Nexxus, we know that hair is made of around 90% proteins, which is why we use advanced scientific methods to identify the protein needs of each hair type. We create customized formulas, with proteins, to bring your hair back to life. COLOR ASSURE Shampoo, with our exclusive PROTEINFUSION blend with Elastin Protein and Quinoa, cleanses color treated hair while enhancing its vibrancy. Sulfate free. Usage: Apply to wet hair. Lather. Rinse. Follow with COLOR ASSURE Conditioner.

Ideal for use at the early stages of hair thinning, this fast-working hair regrowth treatment is clinically proven to regrow up to 25% more hair. Unlike hair loss shampoos and hair thickening products that temporarily plump hair from the outside, Rogaine penetrates the scalp to reactivate shrunken hair follicles, allowing for regrowth of hair. The extra strength 5% Minoxidil formula works to boost hair follicle activity and hair protein production, helping to maintain hair density. This hair thinning treatment comes in a topical solution that is easy to use: Simply apply 1 milliliter directly to your scalp twice daily and massage it through your hair. Like all Rogaine products, it is designed to fit easily into your routine.
				    	
					,ROGAINE Extra Strength Topical Solution is clinically proven to regrow hair in men with hereditary hair loss and help reverse its progression. It contains the FDA-approved topical ingredient minoxidil and works to enlarge shrunken follicles (increasing their size). This allows for normal healthy hair to develop over time.,Men's ROGAINE Extra Strength Topical Solution is clinically proven to regrow hair in men. To get the most out of ROGAINE Extra Strength Solution, it's important to apply it directly to your scalp--twice a day, every day., , Although there are several causes of hair loss, male-pattern baldness (also referred to as androgenetic alopecia or hereditary hair loss) accounts for about 95% of hair loss in men. It is usually triggered by a combination of hormonal activity and heredity, which together cause the hair follicles in your scalp to shrink., Over time, the progressive shrinking of certain scalp follicles leads to a shortening of the hair's growing cycle. Hair becomes thinner and shorter, until there is no growth at all. The active ingredient in ROGAINE--minoxidil--reinvigorates shrunken hair follicles, which increases their size and helps regrow thicker looking hair over time., , Like many great discoveries, the power of minoxidil to regrow hair came about by chance. In the 1980s, scientists discovered that minoxidil, being studied for other indications, actually showed signs of regrowing hair., ROGAINE applied this discovery to produce the first topical brand approved by the FDA to regrow hair. Minoxidil is the only over-the-counter ingredient FDA approved to regrow hair. Since the discovery, ROGAINE has empowered millions of people to take control of their hair loss with a series of breakthroughs., , ROGAINE is the first topical brand approved by the FDA to regrow hair--in both men and women. With more than 20 years of results and over 20,000 people in clinical trials, ROGAINE is the #1 dermatologist-recommended brand for hair regrowth.

Normally, in feeding infants, gradual introduction of solid foods after 4–6 months of age is an important developmental as well as nutritional step.In cases of severe and multiple food allergies or intolerances, PurAmino is sometimes continued as a milk substitute in the diet of children. This and similar supplemental use of PurAmino in the diet beyond 24 months of age may make a significant contribution to maintenance of good nutrition in such patients. When PurAmino is used as a milk substitute, the total calcium content of the diet should be assessed. Extended use of PurAmino (or other infant formulas) as a sole source of diet is most appropriately monitored by physicians and nutritionists on a case-by-case basis, with attention to developmental as well as nutritional implications of such a dietary regimen.

Studio Ink is another side of Hallmark. (We’re different.) Unexpected, uninhibited and unforgettable, Studio Ink is about creating connections with those who matter most in a way that feels real. We resonate because our cards work no matter who you are, where you live or who you love. Hallmark was founded in 1910 when 18-year-old J.C. Hall arrived in Kansas City, Missouri, with a couple of shoeboxes of postcards under his arm and the American dream in his heart. Hallmark greeting cards are sold online and in nearly 40,000 retail stores across the globe and people continue to recognize the iconic Hallmark brand as ""the very best.""

You'll likely notice subtle flavors of our organic pasture and fresh-from-the-farm taste. Organic Valley's lactose free milk is delicious and nutritious organic milk with the natural enzyme lactase added. Lactase breaks down the milk-sugar lactose into the more easily digestible sugars. Ultra-pasteurized milk has been flash-heated with steam to 280 DegreeF and then vacuum chilled rapidly back down to 38 DegreeF. This temperature variation kills more microorganisms than regular pasteurization. The result is milk with a longer shelf life. Organic Valley milk is produced from certified organic, Grade A milk. Organic Valley is a farmer-owned cooperative with over 2,000 small-family organic farms across the United States. Visit the Organic Valley website to find the Organic Valley farmer nearest to you.

You'll likely notice subtle flavors of our organic pasture and fresh-from-the-farm taste. Ultra-pasteurized milk has been flash-heated with steam to 280°F and then vacuum chilled rapidly back down to 38°F. This temperature variation kills more microorganisms than regular pasteurization. The result is milk with a longer shelf life. Organic Valley milk is produced from certified organic, Grade A milk. Organic Valley is a farmer-owned cooperative with over 2,000 small-family organic farms across the United States. Visit the Organic Valley website to find the Organic Valley farmer nearest to you.

The exact amount of food your dog requires will need to be adjusted according to age, activity and environment. But a good place to start is with these guidelines for an average, active, adult dog fed once daily. Feeding Weaning Pups: Start puppies on dry or moistened Pro Plan as early as they begin to nibble at solid foods, generally 3-4 weeks of age. Feeding Growing Pups: Feed pups (to six months of age) all of the moistened Pro Plan they will consume at intervals throughout the day. If fed dry, Pro Plan may be kept before pups at all times. Making the Switch to Pro Plan: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Pro Plan can make in your dog, please allow 7-10 days to ease the transition from your dog's current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Pro Plan until you're feeding Pro Plan exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. Feeding for Reproduction: Pro Plan provides the extra nutrition needed by reproducing females in stages of gestation and lactation. Food consumption may vary during gestation, so feed the amount needed to maintain the pregnant female's ideal body condition Food intake may double or even quadruple during lactation. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly. Store in a cool, dry place.

You'll likely notice subtle flavors of our organic pasture and fresh-from-the-farm taste. Organic Valley's lactose free milk is delicious and nutritious organic milk with the natural enzyme lactase added. Lactase breaks down the milk-sugar lactose into the more easily digestible sugars. Ultra-pasteurized milk has been flash-heated with steam to 280 DegreeF and then vacuum chilled rapidly back down to 38 DegreeF. This temperature variation kills more microorganisms than regular pasteurization. The result is milk with a longer shelf life. Organic Valley milk is produced from certified organic, Grade A milk. Organic Valley is a farmer-owned cooperative with over 2,000 small-family organic farms across the United States. Visit the Organic Valley website to find the Organic Valley farmer nearest to you.

The result is milk with a longer shelf life. Organic Valley milk is produced from certified organic, Grade A milk. Organic Valley is a farmer-owned cooperative with over 2,000 small-family organic farms across the United States. Visit the Organic Valley website to find the Organic Valley farmer nearest to you.

We source our Provolone Cheese from a small-family owned dairy in Rhode Island who crafts the rGBH-free milk. The pork used to make our salami is raised by a community of small independent U.S. family farmers in the Midwest committed to sustainable and humane practices. Our farmers follow our strict animal welfare protocols and are all Certified Humane. We never treat animals with antibiotics-ever and only used 100% vegetarian feeds. All animals are raised outdoors or in-deeply bedded pens with plenty of room to root and roam as nature indented, resulting in the finest tasting meat.

Why We Go Organic Why is organic so important to us? Simple. It's good for people and good for the environment. Organic farmers work with nature to build rich, healthy soil and preserve biodiversity and critical water resources. Organic farming also means crops are grown without the use of genetic engineering (GMOs) or synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. By eating organic, we not only limit our exposure to these synthetic chemicals but also respect and utilize nature's rich ecosystem. It's food just the way it should be.

We work with a co-op of smaller dairy farms that always pay careful attention to the well-being of the cows and feed them a 100% organic diet - that's good news for the cows. Supporting organic products, like milk, helps encourage organic agriculture. Organic farming prohibits the use of persistent pesticides and genetically engineered seed to help protect the land and water supply - that's good news for the earth. Our milk is never ultra-pasteurized. Though it shortens the life of each carton, we believe using traditional, lower heat pasteurization gives our milk its delicious, wholesome flavor - that's good news for you. Pour a glass. Change the world.

We work with a co-op of smaller dairy farms that always pay careful attention to the well-being of the cows and feed them a 100% organic diet - that's good news for the cows. Supporting organic products, like milk, helps encourage organic agriculture. Organic farming prohibits the use of persistent pesticides and genetically engineered seed to help protect the land and water supply - that's good news for the earth. Our milk is never ultra-pasteurized. Though it shortens the life of each carton, we believe using traditional, lower heat pasteurization gives our milk its delicious, wholesome flavor - that's good news for you. Pour a glass.

Working with Nature Cascadian Farm Roots The story of Cascadian Farm starts over 40 years ago with Gene Kahn. Gene was an idealistic, 24-year-old graduate school dropout who wanted to make a difference in the world. Concerned about industrial farming's impact on our food and ecosystem, Gene was determined to help restore faith in food. So he founded a small, organic farm on a little stretch of land in beautiful Skagit Valley, Washington. That farm quickly grew and became a pioneer in the burgeoning organic food industry. Today, Cascadian Farm has grown well beyond the Home Farm, but Gene's mission continues: to bring you delicious, organic food you can believe in.

Working with Nature Cascadian Farm Roots The story of Cascadian Farm starts over 40 years ago with Gene Kahn. Gene was an idealistic, 24-year-old graduate school dropout who wanted to make a difference in the world. Concerned about industrial farming's impact on our food and ecosystem, Gene was determined to help restore faith in food. So he founded a small, organic farm on a little stretch of land in beautiful Skagit Valley, Washington. That farm quickly grew and became a pioneer in the burgeoning organic food industry. Today, Cascadian Farm has grown well beyond the Home Farm, but Gene's mission continues: to bring you delicious, organic food you can believe in.

Niman Ranch pork is combines with organic wine and Spanish paprika for a Pepperoni like you have never tasted-full flavor with a light spice. The Pepperoni is crafted by a fourth generation artisan sausage maker-we never use heat to speed up the natural drying process, we never add fillers such as dry milk or corn syrup, we never add artificial ingredients or preservatives- just meat, secret family recipe of spices and time. We source our Provolone Cheese from a small-family owned dairy in Rhode Island who crafts the rGBH-free milk. The pork used to make our salami is raised by a community of small independent U.S. family farmers in the Midwest committed to sustainable and humane practices. Our farmers follow our strict animal welfare protocols and are all Certified Humane. We never treat animals with antibiotics-ever and only used 100% vegetarian feeds. All animals are raised outdoors or in-deeply bedded pens with plenty of room to root and roam as nature indented, resulting in the finest tasting meat.

Natural and pure, Kerrygold butter has been trusted and enjoyed around the world for over 50 years. It is produced to the most exacting requirements and standards made with milk from grass-fed cows raised on Irish dairy farms. The winds, rain and warming influence of the Gulf Stream all contribute to the lush grass our cows feed on year-round. They produce the richest milk in the world, which makes our butter taste creamy and glow a healthy, golden yellow. Using generations of Irish butter making knowledge, we create European-style butter that is scrumptious on anything you choose to use it on, from crispy baked potatoes to fresh baked bread. Irish butter has been churned longer and has a higher milkfat content. This process gives our butter a tangy, rich flavor and makes it ideal for baking, especially for flaky, golden pastries. It also means our butter has a rather soft, creamy texture. The natural golden color of our butter comes from beta-carotene that naturally occurs in the grass our cows eat. Kerrygold milk is supplied by 14,000 co-op farmers, and we are committed to sustainability, to supporting Irish family dairy farms, and promoting Ireland's grass-fed dairy farming system which makes Ireland the most carbon efficient milk producer in the EU.
